SIMPLE KEYLOGGER
Utilizing Python libraries like pynput to capture and monitor keystrokes.
Handling file operations to log and save key presses.
Understanding the ethical considerations of creating and using keyloggersâ€”especially ensuring they are only used in controlled environments with consent.
The process was a great way to solidify my understanding of event-driven programming and file I/O in Python. The keylogger runs smoothly, capturing and logging key presses until stopped with the Esc key.
Even a simple project like this can teach a lot about how input devices work and how to responsibly apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios.
